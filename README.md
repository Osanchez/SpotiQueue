# What is it?

SpotiQueue is an improved collaborative playlist creation platform for spotify.

# What can it do?

Create playlists with friends and discover new music outside of the top 100 bubble. Spotiqueue is a great place to discover up and coming artists, or a way to stay up to date with friends on the newest and hottest tracks. 

# How does it work?

Unlike the built in collaborative playlist maker, you just don't add tracks to a playlist. You vote on them.
With this new collaborative feature, everyone has the option to determine if a a track makes it into a playlist or not.

# Inspiration behind SpotiQueue?

I wanted to create a platform that allowed people to discover music together with friends and family.
