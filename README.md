# What is it?

SpotiQueue is a collaborative playlist creation platform for spotify.

# What Can I do?

Create playlists with friends and discover new music outside of the top 100 bubble. Spotiqueue is a great place to discover up and coming artists, or a way to stay up to date with friends on the newest and hottest tracks.

# Inspiration Behind SpotiQueue?

I wanted to create a platform that allowed people to discover music together with friends and family.
